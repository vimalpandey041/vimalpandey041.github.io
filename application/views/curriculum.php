A caring ethos underpins our whole curriculum <br> <br>

Children are at the centre of our curriculum. We believe that everyone works best in a climate where they feel comfortable, secure and happy. These conditions are essential if children and adults are to give their best. <br><br>

We aim to provide a curriculum which is relevant, motivating and is fundamental to all learning.

<h4 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[red] py-4 px-6" id="literacy">Literacy</h4>
<p class=" text-justify  py-2 px-6">
In Nursery and Preparatory Classes, pupils are encouraged to develop early reading and writing skills through a mixture of formal teaching and self-selected activities. English skills are incorporated into all of the work that the children do with the aim of teaching them the joy and importance of language through relevant and stimulating tasks.
<br> <br>

In the Junior section, children have at least one hour of English each day during the Literacy Hour. This includes writing, reading and spelling. Most children begin to learn to read and write soon after starting school. From the start, we emphasise the development of spoken and written English. We regard the acquisition of reading and writing skills as a priority.

<h4 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[red] py-4 px-6" id="fieldtrips">Field Trips</h4>
<p class="text-justify py-2 px-6">Memories of school field trips are among the most prominent of the formative years, largely because they are a welcome break in the routine for both students and teachers. While their purpose is essentially to educate, they can also be a fun bonding experience for everyone involved.
  <br> <br>

Field trips, a popular activity for all students, are regularly organized by Delhi Public School Mahendragarh. No matter how old they are, kids love to explore new places with their friends. A journey undertaken by the students to a place away from their normal environment provides them with an opportunity for observation for education, or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates.
<br> <br>

Our students at every level enjoy going to various field trips organized by our teachers throughout the year. Our students enjoy every part of their trip while significant learning takes place simultaneously. Such trips reinforce what a teacher has been teaching in class about a subject and help students understand the topic better.</p>
<h4 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[red] py-4 px-6" id="learningthroughactivities">Learning through Activities</h4>
<p class="text-justify py-2 px-6">At Delhi Public School Mahendragarh, we integrate a wide range of creative activities within our overall educational programme. We consider that artistic and cultural activities to be very important with regard to the harmonious development of the total personality. Every child at Delhi Public School Mahendragarh has vocal, dance, yoga, games and sports, art and craft as part of the regular timetable. Other activities like dramatics, creative writing, debating, elocution, quizzing and much more also form an essential part of education at Delhi Public School Mahendragarh. Excursions and field trips are also a part of our learning experience.</p>
